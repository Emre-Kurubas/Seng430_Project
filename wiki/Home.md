# Welcome to the SENG 430 Healthcare ML Training Tool Wiki! 🏥

Welcome to the official documentation hub for our SENG 430 final project. This wiki serves as the central repository for our team's planning, meeting notes, architecture, and feature progress.

## 🎯 About the Project

Our project aims to bridge the gap between healthcare professionals/students and Machine Learning. We are building a **7-step Machine Learning web application** that supports **20 distinct clinical domains**. Users can easily upload their datasets, preprocess them, train popular ML models, and evaluate the results all within a user-friendly interface.

## 🛠️ Project Capabilities

Our platform integrates 6 core classification models:
1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3. Decision Trees
4. Random Forest
5. Logistic Regression
6. Naive Bayes

By utilizing this tool, users will be able to complete a comprehensive ML pipeline and even receive a downloadable certificate indicating their successful completion!
